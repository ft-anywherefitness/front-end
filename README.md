Anywhere Fitness App

Anywhere Fitness: These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing.

This is an app designed during a Lambda School build week.
